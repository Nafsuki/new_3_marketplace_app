## Features

⚡️ Fetching users & ads data from fake REST API using React Hooks. (useState, useEffect)\
⚡️ Tried Testing for the Users component

If I had more time...

- I would work on the design to complete UI, using Layout component to have Nav, Main, Footer reusable components and make it fully responsive.
- Add more testing
